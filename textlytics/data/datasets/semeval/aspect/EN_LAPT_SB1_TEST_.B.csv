73,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,This laptop is fine for those applications and basic websurfing.,
74,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#GENERAL,"The speakers are fairly basic, so this is probably not the computer to buy if your main aim is streaming music or watching movies.",
75,MOUSE#DESIGN_FEATURES,The touchpad is a little &quot;clunky&quot; for my taste; I use a small external mouse with laptops  in any event.,
76,KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES,I appreciate the relatively large keyboard (with number pad) and screen size.,

84,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"Well, my first impressions are that its OK, it certainly boots up quickly (thanks SSD!), and from the limited use so far (no games) its fast enough in normal usage.",
85,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"It certainly looks nice, but that nice dark blue top is a fingerprint magnet as others have pointed out.",
86,MOUSE#USABILITY,"Also I have found the touch pad to be awkward to use (could be I am pressing too hard perhaps), and the screen is    well   underwhelming.",
87,LAPTOP#GENERAL,To be honest I am a little disappointed and considering returning it.,

130,COMPANY#GENERAL,"To a prospective buyer,  08/10/2012  Once you go Mac, you'll never go back.",

169,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES,The headphones jack is a combo jack for the headphones and microphone.,
170,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#DESIGN_FEATURES,"Not a big deal for me, but if you Skype a lot or are gaming a regular headphone set with a separate jack for the headphone sound and microphone input will not work on a Mac.",
171,,"These are about twice the price of an equivilant Windows machine so it was a tough decision, but like I said I am pleased so far.....",

181,KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES,"- Its keyboard is nicely arranged, silent, and back-lit which is nice, but what I don't like about it is the material attracts oil from your fingers.",
182,KEYBOARD#QUALITY,I have to clean it regularly for it to stay looking good.,
183,LAPTOP#QUALITY,"- This laptop is so silent, its fans only kick in when the laptop is under heavy load, thanks to the 5th generation Intel core which draws less power,  thus less heat.",
184,,"- It's comfortable to have it on my lap, because the weight is evenly distributed to he laptop's body and not accumulated on the screen like most &amp;#34;hybrid&amp;#34; ones do.",
185,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,- It can run games really well.,
186,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"Well, not really well.",
187,DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,MOBAs like Dota 2 and SMITE can be run on max quality settings with 60 fps or more.,

201,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"Pay me now, Pay me later.........I am happy with my choice going with this laptop.",
202,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I was disappointed.,

214,,Installed Parallels 8 on it and windows 7 and windows 8 actually works excellent (should i provoke some people and say that i find it works better than the Mac OS).,
215,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,The magnetic lid and charger is cool and battery indicator on the side is cool.,
216,,Used my IR remote with it and was kinda glad i didn't buy the retina display or the air.,
217,,I don't have any technical pearls to share.,
218,,I can provide a review from a layman's viewpoint.,

229,,The Retinal  display laptops don't allow for much tinkering.,
230,,"I wanted to be able to add  my own memory, add a second hard drive, and in the future replace the  battery when it begins to fail.",
231,LAPTOP#USABILITY,This Mac allows all of that.,
232,,I don't game a lot  so I don't need a super HD display; for that I use my AppleTV to display on  my 52&amp;#34; TV.,
233,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"This is very fast, high performance computer.",
234,LAPTOP#GENERAL,This should be more than  enough computer for almost everyone.,
235,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I would not hesitate recommending  this to anyone.,
236,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,It fast and easy to set up.,
237,LAPTOP#USABILITY,I had cloned my data from my old computer using  Carbon Copy Cloner (CCC) and simply moved everything to the new computer  and was off and running at speeds I had only dreamed up before.,
238,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"The Mac book pro is a computer for the disorganized, lazy, and eye candy person in all of us.",
239,,"With my PC, understanding how to jump through hoops is important.",
240,LAPTOP#USABILITY,The MacBook pro already understands how to jump through hoops and acts more like a friendly guide.,
241,SOFTWARE#USABILITY,"If you want to use the Internet, then you can make your icons jump out from the bottom of the screen, like a magnifying glass is projecting onto the selected icon.",
242,LAPTOP#USABILITY,This computer is amazing for the individual who does not want to do any extra work via their understanding of their laptop.,

262,,"I was considering buying the Air, but in reality, this one has a more powerful performance and seems much more convenient, even though it's about .20 inch thicker and 2 lbs heavier.",
263,KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES,"I'm not sure if it was covered in the description, but it does have a backlit keyboard and I'm getting about an 8 hour battery life on one charge (Except I don't use this for games or videos, which obviously would drain the battery faster).",

272,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I could not believe they did not consider the battery as defective so I went to the Apple store myself and asked for a manager.,
273,SUPPORT#QUALITY,He explained to me the battery expansion is 'normal'.,
274,SUPPORT#QUALITY,Apple doesn't cover battery expansion under any circumstances not even under their Apple Care.,
275,SUPPORT#QUALITY,The battery is simply considered 'consumable' and NOT covered.,
276,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I asked the manager if he feels comfortable with me posting the picture of the MacBook Air on the internet with the description that Apple doesn't consider the product defective.,
277,SUPPORT#QUALITY,"His reply astonished me, looking down at me behind his thick glasses he said: 'Make sure you have your facts straight before you smear!",
278,,They will contact you.',
279,SUPPORT#QUALITY,He didn't specify who are 'they' but from the tone of his voice and his 6'5' posture it indicated something between the SWAT team and a bunch of LAWYERS.,
280,COMPANY#GENERAL,"Here is my take on all of this, the business model Apple pushes right now is to get some cheap junk from China, hire a bunch of cheerleaders straight out of high school, call them geniuses, and bully everybody who complains about their product.",
281,COMPANY#GENERAL,"Steve Jobs is dead, so is Apple.",
282,COMPANY#GENERAL,No more Apple devices in my household.,

288,,Oops.,
289,COMPANY#GENERAL,That's the only issue I've ever had since working on Macs in 1995.,
290,COMPANY#GENERAL,That's a pretty impressive track record don't you think?,
291,,I purchased this laptop back in June 2015 after doing a lot of research on different laptops I was interested in.,
292,,"While I have only ever owned HP laptops, I made sure to look into other brands, including Asus, Dell, and Microsoft.",

302,,"However, the physical keyboard is much nicer than the detachable ones found on other laptops and tablets.",
303,KEYBOARD#USABILITY,I find it much easier to type on and much more durable.,
304,BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,Battery Life- My battery life is really good with this laptop and I have had no problems with it thus far.,
305,BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,I can usually go about 10 hours before I get down to 10% battery life.,
306,,"My last laptop had terrible battery life, lasting only about an hour on a full charge, so this isn't too shabby at all for a laptop.",
307,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"The Cons:  No Disc Drive- Call me old fashioned, but I still enjoy listening to physical CDs and uploading them to iTunes.",
308,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"However, I can no longer do this because this laptop does not contain a disc drive.",
309,,"While it is entirely possible to buy a disc drive, I do not feel like it is something I absolutely need.",
310,,"If you are an avid CD listener though or want to watch DVDs from your laptop, I would suggest buying the separate disc drive.",
311,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"Overall, I definitely would recommend this product to any college student that is in the market for a new laptop.",
312,DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES,The touchscreen and 2-in-1 capability is a huge bonus and it is really easy to carry around to your classes.,
313,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,It also is nice to be able to play Candy Crush or Angry Birds when in between classes straight from your laptop.,
314,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,It makes it much more exciting to play!,
315,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I'm actually writing this review on my new MacBook and I love it!,
316,,The seller was great and I had my computer within 2 days.,
317,LAPTOP#GENERAL,The computer it self is amazing.,
318,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"It is an older model, so know that upfront, but it is everything I was looking for.",
319,,"I wanted a laptop that had a CD drive, since most new laptops do not have one, a laptop with an actual hard drive, since the new MacBooks do not, and I wanted to get away from PCs.",
320,,"I actually spent $600 on a PC before I bought this MacBook and returned it with 24 hours because it was slow, and I could not stand windows 10.",
321,LAPTOP#GENERAL,From the moment I received this MacBook it was like a dream come true.,
322,,"It is a little sluggish, which was to be expected with the 4GB ram, but even at its sluggish it is faster than the PC I bought.",
323,MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES,I know once I upgrade the ram to 8GB it will pick up a lot.,
324,,"As an added bonus I plan on upgraded to 16GB down the road, but 8 will do for now.",
325,,The price for the ram is about $80 so this lap top is still cheaper than a brand new MacBook.,
326,LAPTOP#USABILITY,"Also, if after reading some reviews and doing some research I found out that this laptop is easily upgradable and easy to work on which is another big plus.",
327,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"So long story short, if you want an oldie but a goodie this is your laptop.",
328,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"I know people were complaining that it isn't the newest model, but it all depends on what you are looking for.",
329,,"It's the perfect size for someone who is using a laptop for school or everyday use, and while it is a little heaver than the MacBook Air, at 5ish pounds, its really not that bad.",
330,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I highly recommend!!,
331,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"This computer is a fantastic tool for word processing, searching the internet, and keeping track of everyday life.",
332,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"It's also incredibly light, has a battery that can last for days, and looks like a piece of art.",
333,LAPTOP#PRICE,"Though, that's pretty much what your paying for -- a well designed device.",
334,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"When you look at the internal specs, the computer is only worth about $500.",
335,HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES,"It has a 128 GB storage capacity (but with the option of a 256 GB hard drive) and a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, so don't expect to be gaming on this computer and make sure you pick up an external hard drive too.",
336,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"If your looking to be a trendy hipster who can't live without a Mac, it's a great buy.",
337,,"Otherwise, go with a cheaper computer or consider spending a little more for the Pro.",
338,,Got it directly from ASUS.,
339,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,It mixes a great balance between the spec that are needed and what you don't need.,
340,,Most system now a days have something great but miss something that you will be looking for.,

359,LAPTOP#GENERAL,Over all very good system and worth it.,
360,,Wonder its hard to get .. Getting sold on a higher price in Amazon.,
361,,ASUS always shows sold out.,
362,LAPTOP#GENERAL,This was the ONLY tablet-style computer so far which met my requirements.,
363,,It's replacing a first generation Surface Pro that is too bulky and heavy to effectively use (my preference).,
364,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"I was seduced by this computer, so I took it home.",
365,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"The wireless keyboard (not bluetooth, but RF) did not pair up with the device.",
366,,"I proceeded to make all updates for Sony Vaio, including the BIOS.",
367,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,It still did not pair.,
368,,"I've used the Pairing Tool, which is located in the Windows directory.",
369,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,I even ran it as Administrator -- still no effect.,
370,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"I used the Ctrl-Esc keys while turning on, and still nothing.",
371,,"It's charged, the light comes on.",
372,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,It flickers briefly to green before the light goes out.,
373,,"I upgraded to Windows 8.1, and repeated the sequence on software loads.",
374,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,I still can't pair it.,
375,KEYBOARD#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,I don't want to carry around a bluetooth keyboard for a computer whose keyboard is nonfunctional.,
376,,"I may give it one more shot tonight, then I'm returning it to the vendor.",
377,,I will update it if I get it working with the procedure.,
378,,"I'm not playing the game of send in a computer or wait for a new keyboard, while my return window is still open.",
379,LAPTOP#QUALITY,Sony can eat the cost from the seller on this one while I get my money back for a DEFECTIVE product.,
380,,Others have posted about this keyboard issue.,
381,COMPANY#GENERAL,But Sony doesn't seem to have addressed it.,
382,,"UPDATE:  after the hassle of a return, waiting in line, then sitting around the store to allow the computer and keyboard to charge sufficiently, I was able to obtain a keyboard which was paired out of the box with the computer.",
383,LAPTOP#GENERAL,My first Mac computer and as many before me I just fall in love with it.,
384,HARD_DISC#DESIGN_FEATURES,Changed the memory from 4 GB to 8 GB Corsair Vengeance and 500 GB HDD (5400 rpm) with Seagate hybride 750 GB HDD+SSD.,

386,LAPTOP#USABILITY,Way to go and enjoy both worlds.,
387,,Thank you Amazon.,
388,,"There are a lot of things a laptop can do these days, and if you ask me, many of them should be automatically included in every laptop, no matter what.",
389,,-  Do you remember when computers didn't have cameras on them?,
390,,"No? OK We're looking at a generation gap(s) here, but yes, back in the day, computers didn't have cameras on them.",
391,,"Now, it's unthinkable to buy a computer without one.",
392,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"This ASUS you're looking at right here, and that I'm typing on right now, has one.",
393,LAPTOP#PRICE,"-  With that being said, for the price ($800!), you get a nice fast laptop, but if you ask me, it's missing some things that I feel should be automatically included:",
394,DISPLAY#DESIGN_FEATURES,"This laptop has no:  - Touchscreen  - Optical Drives (OK, a bit of a stretch, because that would eat up precious space in this monster)  - Swivel or detachable screen",
395,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"What this laptop does have is:  - Windows 8, which is confusing as all get-out  - Tons of &amp;#34;bloatware&amp;#34;.",
396,,I didn't even know what that was until I got this.,
397,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"This is really nice, but I HATE the awkward right mouse clicking.. sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.. may be the laptop, may be the laptop in conjunction with Windows 8?",
398,MOUSE#USABILITY,"Either way, highly annoying.",
399,LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY,I hooked up a USB mouse and all is well.,
400,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,All works beautifully but Windows 8 is taking a bit of getting used to.,
401,,I paid the $100 for Professional version to join it to our server and private business network.,
402,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"Love the 360 degree rotation and the touch screen works great, but a little bit of a learning curve there too, as sometimes I have to tap a few times to get the exact location I need...",
403,LAPTOP#GENERAL,overall it is just my learning a few things than any downfall with the laptop (the mouse was the only negative I could really see)...,
404,LAPTOP#GENERAL,This is a fantastic transformer!,
405,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I loved playing with it and the touchscreen was great for the windows 8 platform.,
406,,The seller was amazing to work with on my return.,
407,SOFTWARE#USABILITY,"The only reason I returned it was because I bought it to use the touchscreen with photoshop and because of the program, it could not utilize the touchscreen within the work space except to zoom and rotate.",
408,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I would have kept it but that was the sole reason for my purchase.,
409,LAPTOP#GENERAL,It's a great product and would recommend to anyone looking for a transformer or large touchscreen.,
410,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I'm looking forward to needing a laptop update so I can purchase this computer again.,
411,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"I've only had this for a week Overall I like the computer, it's thin &amp; light and The wireless keyboard works great.",
412,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,I was impressed; Sony puts in small touches like a USB charging port on the charger.,
413,HARDWARE#QUALITY,"One thing I did't like is the stylus holder, it's cheap plastic and doesn't seem to be well thought out because it gets installed on the cover for the USB port.",
414,HARDWARE#QUALITY,"I do't use it, I think I would accidently break it and loose my stylus.",
415,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,The other Issue I had was the amount of time it takes to update the operating system and all the software when you get it.,

417,,"Make sure you follow the directions on the updates, I followed the directions and didn't have any problems...",

427,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY,The only downside are the speakers.,
428,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY,They don't go very loud at all.,
429,MULTIMEDIA_DEVICES#QUALITY,The quality of the sound is nice but the lack of volume really kills it for me.,

441,,"I just bought this MacBook Pro a few weeks ago, and the user interface was so simple I got used to my computer in a matter of days, rather than the year it took for me to master Microsoft Windows 7.",

448,DISPLAY#QUALITY,"Overall, the screen resolution, though non-retina, is sufficient for normal web browsing and work.",
449,,"I still don't get why retina displays are standard on most new iOS devices, but are only available on the MacBook Pro with Retina Display (Total cheapskate!).",
450,PORTS#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,The thunderbolt port is awesome!,
451,,It's 10gbps transfer speeds surpass even the super-fast USB 3.0 (Which also comes with the MBP).,

476,,"But remember, you are paying a high premium for a product with better build quality and high quality software, which is a joy to work with, considering that you can finally work in peace without having to worry about the millions of Windows viruses out in the wild attacking countless careless and oblivious PC users.",

500,LAPTOP#USABILITY,"When the MacBook Pro arrived, I helped her transfer all of her schoolwork from the PC to the Mac... an easy drag-and-drop process utilizing a flash drive.",
501,MEMORY#DESIGN_FEATURES,It was delivered with 4GB of RAM -- 2GB on each of two sticks -- which was probably adequate.,

514,COMPANY#GENERAL,I will never ever buy any apple product in my life.,
515,LAPTOP#GENERAL,Overall I love it.,

518,LAPTOP#QUALITY,"I feel like I need to be really gentle with it, but maybe that's just me.",
519,KEYBOARD#DESIGN_FEATURES,"Also, and this maybe is another personal quirk, but the keyboard sits a little far back for my taste so my watch scrapes against the edge of the laptop.",

544,CPU#GENERAL,The SSD and I7 complement each other really well.,
545,,I was torn between this laptop and the zenbook.,
546,,"Ultimately decided on this one because of the processor and having a fan ( I read a lot of reviews about the Zenbook becoming uncomfortably hot during heavy use, which doesn't make sense considering it is a laptop).",
547,OS#GENERAL,"I was pretty skeptical about upgrading to windows 10, but it is pretty awesome.",
548,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"If you are looking for a light, durable, and extremely effecient laptop, buy this one!",

559,OS#USABILITY,Mac User interface is just the best.,
560,,"Have used windows for years, so switching takes a little adjustments but once you get used to it, you won't feel like going back.",
561,LAPTOP#QUALITY,"Also, the laptop is quite, no more burnt laps, best screen display, and small additions like backlit keyboard wins your heart over.",
562,,"Considered MAcBook Air also before buying this Pro, but glad bought the Pro, because I didn't fancy carrying a bunch of adapters, separate DVD player etc.....",
563,,"Honestly didn't see too much difference visually between this screen and the retina display, so didn't fancy paying that much premium for retina, others may fancy that, I didn't.",
564,,"Compared other ultrabooks like Zenbook and the price were very comparable but none of them carry the reputation of Mac, so stuck with Macbook",
565,LAPTOP#QUALITY,Only thing I dislike is that everything for Mac is expensive but I guess you pay for quality!,
566,COMPANY#GENERAL,Not impressed with Macintosh products.,
567,COMPANY#GENERAL,In fact I am completely frustrated.,

593,,"I hope my customer review has been useful, feel free to respond with opinions or feedback about the content of my review.",
594,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"My first laptop ever and it is a flips into a tablet mode also, brilliant.",
595,LAPTOP#GENERAL,So far so good.,
596,BATTERY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,Battery doesn't hold up to what it said in the description but I got it refurb'd and I imagine they swapped out the battery to help cover the costs on the reduced price (Just a guess).,
597,KEYBOARD#USABILITY,"Still getting used to typing on it, my palms keep hitting the mousepad and causing the cursor to jump and moving me off of where I was typing.",
598,,Practice I guess.,

629,LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY,The wifi rumor hasn't happened to me.,
630,LAPTOP#CONNECTIVITY,The wifi works great.,

648,,Luckily that was not the case.,

650,,"I purchased a seagate solid state harddrive, the same kind that apple installs originally.",
651,SUPPORT#QUALITY,And apple was happy to install the latest osx for free!,
652,LAPTOP#GENERAL,You wont be disappointed with this computer!,

666,SUPPORT#QUALITY,Gave me the runaround for an entire day and treated me like an imbecile.,
667,SUPPORT#QUALITY,No one would ever answer my question as to why I couldn't get another new Macbook since this was clearly a factory error and my Macbook was still under warranty.,
668,SUPPORT#QUALITY,"As a matter of fact, no matter how many times I asked that question, the employees I spoke purposely ignored it.",
669,SUPPORT#QUALITY,"They didn't say yes and they didn't say no, they just pretended that I never asked it, which was incredibly frustrating.",
670,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I've been to the &amp;#34;genius&amp;#34; bar several times (they have been very nice).,
671,LAPTOP#QUALITY,"They have now basically replaced everything inside my machine, told me there was a problem with the hardware, so I now have a &amp;#34;refurbished&amp;#34; machine.",
672,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,"Maybe I'm not being reasonable, but I don't feel that's the same as a new computer because I didn't pay for a refurbished computer.",
673,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"I still have weird freezing problems with it and it's pretty slow, but it's not pinpointed enough yet for me to take it in.",
674,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I had delusions of grandeur regarding Apple's &amp;#34;great customer service&amp;#34; and the &amp;#34;reliability of their machines&amp;#34; etc.. etc...blah...blah...,
675,,"I don't love PCs, but every PC I've ever owned has lasted longer than this Macbook, which costs much more than any of those Pcs.",
676,SUPPORT#QUALITY,"I'm sure most people's Macbooks work just fine, but FYI, if you get the factory dud, you're stuck with it and no one at Apple cares or will give a hoot about the money you threw away.",
677,,I was a long time PC user.,
678,,Not a geek or a wonk.,
679,,PC's were just cheaper had more software and were ubiquitous.,
680,,I had an old laptop running Windows XP that I used at home for email.,
681,,A couple Office products and occasionally watched TV on.,
682,,With the EOL of XP.,
683,,"I had to decide if I was going to make a financial commitment to Windows, upgrade, buy new, change.",
684,,I decided NO!  Enough was enough.,
685,,"I was tired or hodge lodge of software products, security updates, malware, junk and endless upgrade trauma with Windows.",
686,,"I did upgrade my old PC to Windows 7, but I went with a MacBook Pro and I am very happy.",
687,LAPTOP#DESIGN_FEATURES,"One OS for this platform, no OEM OS paraphernalia and automatic updates.",
688,LAPTOP#QUALITY,I am happy with the feel the speed and the seamless transition to the MAC!,
689,,"I was told by my daughter that I was &amp;#34;stupid&amp;#34; for spending so much time on a PC just to make it run, when most of that &amp;#34;run stuff&amp;#34; is taken care of by Apple!.",
690,,I told her &amp;#34;real men&amp;#34; use PC's because of the challenge it keeps you sharp technically.,
691,,Her final response was &amp;#34;whatever&amp;#34;!,
692,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"Well she was right, Whatever in the world took me so long to get a computer that just works.",
693,LAPTOP#USABILITY,"I'm no power user, but I have had no learning curve with the MAC and I don't do anything geeky enough forcing me to learn the OS.",
694,SOFTWARE#PRICE,I did buy Office 2008 for the MAC at a very low price to migrate most of my work files for $64 and that was  a steal in my opinion.,
695,LAPTOP#GENERAL,Otherwise I am happily a  Mac user.,
696,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"For a premium laptop sold in 2013, the Apple MacBook Pro (13 inch, base model) is about as basic as it gets: no SSD, no discrete graphics, no 1080p display, and no touch screen.",
697,COMPANY#GENERAL,But Apple does not pretend it has any of these.,
698,SOFTWARE#QUALITY,"What it does have is great reliability on the software side and hardware side, Apple's OSX Mountain Lion, the sleek looks Apple always delivers, reasonable specs, good battery life, nice keyboard, and excellent trackpad.",
699,,"Now, the question is, who is this computer for?",
700,LAPTOP#PRICE,"Those looking for a bargain laptop will shy away from the enormous price tag, and those who want to play the latest games do not ever use Macs.",
701,,"The average computer user will be served better by a Macbook Air, since it is faster (for basic tasks), lighter, and has a higher-res antiglare screen.",
702,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"The MacBook Pro 13.3 inch laptop is for those who want to use a Mac, but value performance and upgradability over weight and screen resolution.",
703,LAPTOP#QUALITY,This Mac will last longer than any other simply because it is the easiest to upgrade and repair.,
704,LAPTOP#USABILITY,"Hard drives can be replaced, RAM can be added as needed, and the internal battery can be replaced after losing its ability to hold a charge.",
705,,"The processor is roughly 15% faster than the one inside the Macbook Air, which also extends this computer's usable lifespan.",
706,,"The fact that the screen is fairly low-res for the price (MBP 13 has a res of 1280x800, while other windows laptops have a res of 1600x900 for the same price), really detracts from my personal experience with the computer.",
707,,"The retina display of my iPhone 5 has indeed spoiled me, and Apple should update the screen of the MBP 13 or bring down the price of the retina model.",
708,HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"This, added with the fact that the speed of the hard drive is very slow for the money, detracts from the computer's value.",
709,LAPTOP#PRICE,"Lowering the price by one hundred dollars would justify the hard drive and screen and make the computer a five-star purchase, but for the price, this is a four star (good) computer.",
710,,Those looking to drop $1200 on a new laptop will have to decide if the upgradability and processor performance is worth the money over the sleeker MacBook Air.,
711,,"In addition, if Mac OSX is not something you enjoy using, then I would advise that you look elsewhere for a laptop.",
712,HARD_DISC#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"TLDR version: good, reliable laptop with mediocre screen and slow hard drive.",
713,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I am really sorry I bought this machine.,
714,,"I own a 13' air, a 15' Macbook pro (both prior generations).",
715,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I was shocked at how much worse this product has been since my first purchase.,
716,,I have never been to a genius bar since my first purchase (1984).,
717,LAPTOP#QUALITY,This machine has made me go there 5 times and has been nothing but a continuous problem.,
718,MOTHERBOARD#QUALITY,"Finally, they are sending it in for a motherboard replacement.",
719,LAPTOP#QUALITY,(It's a lemon).,
720,COMPANY#GENERAL,"So, I'm cooled on Mac buys.",
721,,I guess those Chinese workers really are unhappy.,
722,,"Update November 1, 2012...    On my last visit to the Genius Bar they sent the machine in to replace the motherboard.",
723,,It came back today.,
724,SUPPORT#QUALITY,They did not replace the motherboard.,
725,SUPPORT#QUALITY,Instead they 'tightened' a loose wire.,
726,SUPPORT#QUALITY,It also has a big new scratch on the top cover.,
727,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I started it up and it still has the same problem I went in to fix.,
728,SUPPORT#QUALITY,So I'm going back to Genius Bar for visit #6.,
729,SUPPORT#QUALITY,I think it may have to be 'Apple Don't Care' instead of Apple Care.,
730,,It was time to replace my 8 year old laptop and I decided to get a &amp;#34;fancy&amp;#34; Mac Book Pro.,
731,LAPTOP#PRICE,"You get what you pay for, right?",
732,,WRONG!,
733,,"If you like your Windows 7, Vista or even XP, just stick with it.",
734,,Any of those are way simpler to use than Apple's Mountain Lion operating system.,
735,OS#DESIGN_FEATURES,Mac is complicated and frustrating at moments.,
736,OS#USABILITY,I watched tutorials and that helped somewhat but not enough.,
737,,I'm a small business owner and a productivity aspect is very important to me.,
738,,Windows operating system is a superior product by far.,
739,,It's actually very obvious.,
740,,Just look at a market share between the two concepts.,
741,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I should have known better.,
742,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I hope you don't make the same mistake...,
743,MOUSE#USABILITY,"When I first got the computer, I noticed the tracking pad was hard to click.",
744,,This was my first Mac so I wasn't familiar with how it was suppose to feel.,
745,,After using my friend's computer I knew something was wrong.,
746,BATTERY#QUALITY,I took my Macbook to the Apple store and they had to replace the battery after 1 month of use since it was swelling.,
747,SUPPORT#QUALITY,They tried to tell me that the battery wasn't covered by the warranty and it costs about $150 to replace.,
748,SUPPORT#QUALITY,They ended up not charging me.,
749,BATTERY#QUALITY,"Other than that battery issue and the battery life does not last too long, I'm pretty happy with the computer.",
750,LAPTOP#MISCELLANEOUS,I'm a designer turned front-end developer and this computer is unusable for front-end development.,
751,,I have a production PC which was much less expensive and way underspeced compared to this Mac.,
752,SOFTWARE#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"Opening photoshop takes FOooooooRRREVER, as do all programs that do not begin with an 'i'.",
753,OS#MISCELLANEOUS,The free upgrade to Mountain Lion FAILED.,
754,,FAILED.,
755,DISPLAY#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,It tried to boot up and the screen just flashed over and over and over again.,
756,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"Before and after I resolved that issue, I saw the damn 'beachball' all the time as the computer tries to figure out what the hell it's doing while I wait for it.",
757,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,I spend so much time waiting for it.,
758,,"Although its display is bright and vibrant the OS so unusable for work, I have moved back to the older, and still over performing PC.",
759,,"The only thing I use this computer for is a Safari tester, and Safari is awful compared to Chrome.",
760,LAPTOP#GENERAL,I can't believe people like these computers.,
761,LAPTOP#OPERATION_PERFORMANCE,"Now that they are not virus free ([...]l) I see absolutely no benefit to Apple products as they are slower, more expensive, and do not last as long.",
762,LAPTOP#GENERAL,Don't waste your money.,
763,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"My HP seemed great at first, then the problems started.....wireless adapter would just &quot;disappear&quot; and the system said it didn't have a network card.",

780,LAPTOP#GENERAL,"I have used this product for only 2 days, but I can't wait to use it more.",
781,OS#GENERAL,I really like Mac/Apple products because of their operating system.,
782,,"I have been a Linux (Ubuntu and Fedora) user for a while because Windows doesn't appeal to me and it is similar to Ubuntu and Fedora but with trackpad gestures, notification center, and I can run iTunes (I couldn't get it to run on Linux).",

786,SOFTWARE#USABILITY,I just ended up using my iPod to transfer my iTunes music and I re-downloaded my Amazon music (losing my ratings).,
787,,"I would recommend this product to anyone having trouble typing on their iOS products, though there are cheaper options; any new computer users, as it is easy to learn; and anyone who needs to be efficient, as the gestures make it very easy to multitask.",

795,LAPTOP#USABILITY,I can almost always fix that quickly by clicking on the 'Show all bookmarks' icon (the open book icon at the upper left).,
