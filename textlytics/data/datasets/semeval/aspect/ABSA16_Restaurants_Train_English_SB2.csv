309,,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!!!,
310,,"First of all, this place is *not* romantic, as claimed by Citysearch's editorial review.",

312,,"The tables are crammed way too close, the menu is typical of any Italian restaurant, and the wine list is simply overpriced.",
313,,Slightly above average wines start at $70+ with only one selection listed at $30+.,
314,,Service is not what one would expect from a joint in this price category.,
315,,"For instance, plates were just dumped on the table, I was handed the wine list upside down, etc....",
316,,Somehow working the italian charm with constant mille grazie does not constitute proper service.,

379,,I have to agree with the previous reviewer.,

428,,Save yourself the time and trouble and skip this one!,
429,,I'll keep this short.,
430,,Amma is nothing special.,
431,,The two star chefs left quite some time ago to open their own place.,
432,,I ate here a week ago and found most dishes average at best and too expensive.,

447,,Will never be back.,
448,,honestly the worst sushi my husband and i had in our entire lives.,
449,,"believe us, we've been eating sushi for over 15 yrs.",
450,,not sure why this restaurant would be rated that highly.,
451,,the all-u-can-eat sushi is definitely in very poor quality.,
452,,"limited menu, no-so-fresh ingredients, thinly-sliced fish, fall-apart rice.",
453,,"the only things u could really taste are the very salty soy sauce (even its low sodium), the vinegar-soaked rice, and the scallion on top of the fish.",
454,,the waitstaffs are nice though.,
455,,wont come back again for sure!,
456,,I have been to Roth's twice and both times were very disappointing.,

469,,We were very pleasantly surprised.,
470,,"The food was delicious (I had a halibut special, my husband had steak), and the service was top-notch.",
471,,"When my dessert came, there was a candle in it - not because anyone asked for one - but because the waiter must have seen me opening my birthday card and gift, and said he knew it was a special occassion of some sort.",
472,,Truly the mark of an attentive waiter.,
473,,I highly recommend the restaurant based on our experience last night.,
474,,We ate at this Thai place following the reviews but very unhappy with the foods.,
475,,We thought that this place is using too much of MSG cooking in the foods.,
476,,Why?,
477,,"They don't concern much of customer's health, just want to make money.",
478,,please don't fool us.,
479,,Have frequented 'ino for several years and the food remains excellent.,

490,,"I like Cafe Noir dont get me wrong, it is jsut that the people who work there are evil and incompetent!!",
491,,"The service was terrible, we had to wait for everything and ask several of different people for the same thing before we were allowed to be served.",
492,,"The waitress, seems to be more concerned of looking good than actually waitressing.",
493,,"After dinner the manager grabbed my boyfriend, asked him: Where are you from...maybe you dont know how things work in America...and in the end stormed away almost teareyed yelling that tips are the only thing they survive on.",
494,,"We did tip, I guess the model/waitress just wanted more and complained to the manager.",
495,,"The whole set up is truly unprofessional and I wish Cafe Noir would get some good staff, because despite the current one this is a great place.",

742,,"Small servings for main entree, i had salmon (wasnt impressed) girlfriend had chicken, it was good.",
743,,Dessert is a joke...dont bother,
744,,"Volare virgins or weekly regulars, everyone gets treated the same and you can't ask for more than that when the service is this friendly.",
745,,"The restaurant has a Family feel, not least with regard to the portions which are enormous; the veal alone could have single-handedly solved third world famine.",
746,,"The anti-pasta was excellent, especially the calamari, as were the filling pasta mains.",
747,,The wine list is extensive and can easily hike up an otherwise reasonably priced meal.,
748,,"Still, any quibbles about the bill were off-set by the pour-your-own measures of liquers which were courtesey of the house...",
749,,Fantastic place.,
750,,Cute and decorative.,
751,,A pleasant surprise.,
752,,Go there to relax and feel like your somewhere else.,
753,,"This is the perfect spot for meeting friends, having lunch, dinner, pre-theatre or after-theatre drinks!",
754,,(Always ask the bartender for the SEASONAL beer!!!,
755,,Guaranteed to be a tasty experience!),
756,,Excellent spot for holiday get togethers with co-workers or friends that you haven't seen in a while.,
757,,I have been doing all of the above at the Heartland Brewery for over 5 years now and I HAVE NEVER BEEN DISAPPOINTED!,
758,,All the people that I bring there go back on their own and bring THEIR friends!,
759,,Go there once and oh yes...you will go back...you will...,
760,,What a great place!,
761,,Not the typical NYC gimmick theme restaurant.,
762,,"A cool bar with great food, and tons of excellent beer.",
763,,And even with it's Pub atmosphere they were great to my kids too!,
764,,Loved it!,
765,,The only thing more wonderful than the food (which is exceptional) is the service.,
766,,The only thing the waiters don't do for you is wipe your chin when you leave.,
767,,Wonderful at holiday time.,
768,,Cozy romantic atomosphere with only around 15 tables at most.,
769,,Service was very prompt but slightly rushed.,
770,,"Food was very good, but not what I would consider out of this world.",
771,,Go here for a romantic dinner but not for an all out wow dining experience.,
772,,My friend from Milan and myself were pleasantly surprised when we arrived and everyone spoke italian.,
773,,Too bad the food wasn't of the same heritage.,
774,,"The porcini mushroom pasta special was tasteless, so was the seafood tagliatelle.",
775,,A real dissapointment.,
776,,But that wasn't the icing on the cake: a tiramisu that resembled nothing I have ever had.,
777,,They should have called it mascarpone with chocolate chips-good but a far cry from what the name implies.,
778,,Priced at upper intermediate range.,
779,,I really liked this place.,
780,,"Everything I had was good, and I'm a eater.",
781,,It was pretty inexpensive too.,

793,,"I can't wait for summer, when they serve outside on their gigantic patio.",
794,,Ahhh...,
795,,I recently tried Suan and I thought that it was great.,
796,,This little place definitely exceeded my expectations and you sure get a lot of food for your money.,
797,,The service was fast and friendly and the food was very tasty and they had the best hot sauce to add to your meals.,

821,,bottles of wine are cheap and good.,
822,,What more could you want?,
823,,The food was actually aweful.,
824,,I'm not picky - but it was actually gross.,
825,,"The mussles were the fishiest things I've ever tasted, the seabass was bland, the goat cheese salad was missing the goat cheese, the penne w/ chicken had bones in it... It was disgusting.",
826,,"Nice atmosphere, the service was very pleasant and the desert was good.",
827,,Wouldn't recomend it for dinner!,
828,,This is the perfect date spot for Williamsburg couples.,

844,,The food's as good as ever.,

851,,"I got the $10 10-piece dim sum combo, every bite of which was great.",
852,,But $1 for each small piece???,
853,,Not worth it.,
854,,I won't go back unless someone else is footing the bill.,
855,,I came here with my boyfriend for our anniversary because it was highly recommended to him by a friend.,
856,,The decor is very simple but comfortable.,
857,,The food was delicious but do not come here on a empty stomach.,
858,,The portions are small but being that the food was so good makes up for that.,
859,,You must have the crabmeat lasagna which is out of this world and the chocolate bread pudding for dessert.,
860,,The staff there is very attentive and down to earth.,
861,,I loved it and would go again.,
862,,Just moved to the neighborhood and we've been trying all the West Village Sushi restaurants.,
863,,"If you don't mind pre-sliced low quality fish, unfriendly staff and a sushi chef that looks like he is miserable then this is your place.",
864,,Price and quality of fish alone will keep us from making a return visit.,
865,,Wasn't going to share but I feel obligated...while sitting at the sushi bar dining we watched the chef accidentally drop a piece of Unagi on the floor and upon retrieving it from the floor proceed to use the piece in the delivery order he was preparing.,
866,,No thanks!!!,
867,,"This place, which is only a few months old, is perhaps Queens' biggest secret!",
868,,"Fabulous decor - makes you feel like you're in a trendy Manhattan restaurant, very very good food, cheaply-priced, generally friendly staff, and if you're a Manhattanite, or spend most of your time in Manhattan, Rice Avenue will make you feel at home.....very Soho/Village/Upper West Side minus the expensive prices and pretentious clientele.....all on Roosevelt Avenue!",
869,,We were seated outside and the waiter spilled red wine and hot tea on myself and my date.,
870,,We were then shooed inside.,
871,,"One would think we'd get an apology or complimentary drinks - instead, we got a snobby waiter wouldn't even take our order for 15 minutes and gave us lip when we asked him to do so.",
872,,"We left, never to return.",
873,,"With so many good restaurants on the UWS, I don't need overpriced food, absurdly arrogant wait-staff who don't recognize they work at a glorified diner, clumsy service, and management that doesn't care.",
874,,I have never before eaten 40 pieces of relatively good nigiri.,

888,,The food is great.,
889,,Personal pans are the perfect size for those hungry nights.,
890,,I heartily recommend.,
891,,There is a downside if you're ordering in -- the delivery guys have MAJOR attitude.,
892,,Never have I had such dramatic delivery guys (a lot of huffing and panting and muttering under breath b/c I live in a walkup) who always seem disappointed with their tips.,
893,,"Hey, I think $2+ for a 5 block walk ain't bad.",
894,,"Love the scene first off- the place has a character and nice light to it..very fortunate, location wise.",
895,,The pizza was pretty good and huge.,
896,,The price very reasonable.,
897,,We were 4 and got the family size penne a la vodka which was tremendously gigantic portion...a bucket of food literally.,
898,,We got most of it back at home with us.,
899,,I would say that all was fine and tasty but the heaviness on my stomach someting that i can't not mention or undermine.,
900,,"The pasta penne was pretty extra buttery, creamy which means a big task to diggest.. tasty at first but i would say that i was full with a slice of pizza and 7 to count, penne...got a little moody afterwards cause was stuffed...lol",
901,,"No, really.",
902,,I have eaten a lot of pizza here.,

918,,"Over the years the host, Vittorio, and his crew, have always treated me as family--although with all the business this not-so-little gem does, it amazing he's even able to remember a consistent but not-so-frequent visitor.",
919,,"I've also been amazed at all the new additions in the past few years: A new Jazz Bar, the most fantastic Dining Garden, the Best Thin Crust Pizzas, and now a Lasagna Menu which is to die for (these are not your average lasagnas)!",
920,,I lOVE THIS PLACE!,

1071,,The wine list was extensive - though the staff did not seem knowledgeable about wine pairings.,

1074,,I had fish and my husband had the filet - both of which exceeded our expectations.,
1075,,"The dessert (we had a pear torte) was good - but, once again, the staff was unable to provide appropriate drink suggestions.",

1103,,"I showed it to the manager, and he smilingly apologized and brought us two free desserts (but did not ask us what we wanted and so brought the last two desserts we would have asked for).",
1104,,"When the bill came, nothing was comped, so I told the manager very politely that we were willing to pay for the wine, but I didn't think I should have to pay for food with a maggot in it.",
1105,,"Yes, I ate the food, but I certainly would not have if I had seen the maggot before eating, and I was at this point fairly sick to my stomach.",
1106,,"The manager finally said he would comp the two glasses of wine (which cost less than the food), and made it seem like a big concession.",
1107,,We paid and left because we didn't feel like arguing any more.,
1108,,"I have worked in restaurants and cook a lot, and there is no way a maggot should be able to get into well prepared food.",
1109,,"For a restaurant with such a good reputation and that is usually so packed, there was no reason for such a lack of intelligent customer service.",
1110,,Unhygienic,

1174,,Terrible Waste of money.. scammers,
1175,,I agree that dining at Casa La Femme is like no other dining experience!,
1176,,BUT not in a good way.,
1177,,I am actually offended to have spent so much money on such a bad experience.,
1178,,I literally just got back home after visiting Casa La Femme and was so offended by my visit felt it necessary to try and warn other diners who value their money and time.,
1179,,We went to celebrate two birthdays and wanted to do something special and different.,
1180,,"Our visit their to say the least, was an unpleasant and costly experience!",
1181,,And even more so unpleasant because it was so costly for such an unpleasant experience.,
1182,,We did arrive late for our reservation so I can not complain too much about the wait for a table.,
1183,,Although we were told 10-15 minutes and it was more like 45 minutes.,
1184,,We were ushered to the bar to wait momentarily and upon arrival were so excited.,
1185,,The place is beautiful!,
1186,,The hostess was very pleasant.,
1187,,"However, our $14 drinks were were horrible!",
1188,,"Once we finally got a table, despite indicating we wanted an alla carte menu we were pushed into a table that was only price fixed!",
1189,,"Since we were already waiting so long, we felt we had no other choice but to accept it.",
1190,,Our experience did not ever get any better.,
1191,,For each course we waited over 1/2 hour to 45 minutes and were never offered a drink.,
1192,,We also asked for Hooka six times and the waiter kept telling us one minute and never returning with the Hooka.,
1193,,After the 4th time i asked again and the waiter than said after our dinner.,
1194,,We asked for beverages and never received them.,
1195,,We asked for sides which the waiter than admitted that he forgot to put in that part of our order.,
1196,,My chicken was inedible as there were so many fatty lumps which i had to keep spitting out into my napkin.,
1197,,I would not expect this for a $55 dinner.,
1198,,By the time we finished our dinner we still had not received one beverage NOR hooka!,
1199,,What we did do was waste 3 hours being trapped in a table waiting and waiting for food and drinks and hooka.. some of which we never received!,
1200,,The only beverage we did receive was water in dirty glasses!,
1201,,To top it all off.. the main reason we came to your restaurant was for the belly dancers and missed the first show as we were not seated yet and the 2nd belly dancer only danced at two tables in the back of the restaurant and never made it around to the other half of the restaurant.,
1202,,"By the time we left our wallets were empy and so were our stomachs AND we missed the show we were supposed to see following our dinner, which would have been acceptable if we got to enjoy the experience of good food and belly dancers!",

1212,,We have gone for dinner only a few times but the same great quality and service is given.,
1213,,Bukhara is on my top 5 Indian places in NYC,
1214,,Wretched and retching,
1215,,This will be only the third online review I have ever made about a restaurant in my life.,
1216,,They have all been tonight and they have all been about the same restaurant.,
1217,,I have never been so disgusted by both food an service.,
1218,,For starters they delivered us someone else's order.,
1219,,"Fine, I wont hang you for that.",
1220,,"However, once I received my predictably mediocre order of what Dokebi thinks passes as Korean fair, (sometimes you have to settle when it's your only option), I got through about half my kimchee before I found a piece of random lettuce accompanied by a far more disgusting, slimy, clearly bad piece of fish skin.",
1221,,"Not one to jump to complaints (hence my lack of previous online reviewing), I called the restaurant to give them a heads up that their kitchen might want to check the cleanliness of their prep stations.",
1222,,"My main concern was the sanity of the food that was being sent out to myself and others, but I would be lying is I said that as someone who has worked in restaurants since the age of fifteen I was expecting at least a minimal effort on the part of the restaurant to amend the situation.",
1223,,None was made so i hung up.,
1224,,Less than three minutes passed before I found myself doubled over the toilet.,
1225,,"My girlfriend, being slightly more aggressive, and having been equally disgusted causing her to throw out the remainder of her barely eaten meal, called back only to be informed that I was probably wrong and that it was most likely an oyster, and that we were also blacklisted from their restaurant.",
1226,,"Not only have I worked in restaurants for many years, I am now in culinary school, I am a huge lover of oysters and fish, and my girlfriend is half Korean!",
1227,,We know the difference between and oyster and bad fish.,
1228,,"It wasn't as if this restaurant had any major bragging points before hand, but now it's simply repulsive.",
1229,,Eat at your own risk.,
1230,,Gorgeous place ideal for a romantic dinner,
1231,,I took my boyfriend for a dinner on saturday night.,
1232,,I book a gorgeous white organza tent which included a four course prix fix menu which we enjoyed a lot.,
1233,,The service was spectacular as the waiter knew everything about the menu and his recommendations were amazing!,
1234,,I completely recommend Casa La Femme for any special occasion and to REALLY impress your date.,
1235,,Lives up to the hype,
1236,,We've lived around the corner from this place for over a year and finally had dinner there.,
1237,,We've tried before but it always packed and doesn't take reservations.,
1238,,It was well worth the wait.,
1239,,The wife had the risotto which was amazing.,
1240,,"It doesn't look appetizing as it's covered in squid ink and it turns your lips and teeth black, but the taste was phenomenal.",
1241,,The farro salad and the mashed yukon potatoes were also extremely tasty.,
1242,,i love margherita pizza – i looove east village pizza,
1243,,"Love this place, every time we are in the city this is one of the places we always go.",
1244,,A quintessential slice of NYC pizza.,
1245,,"The crust has a great bite and a good chew, the sauce is light with a nice acidity to it, the salt from the cheese is great, really heightens the flavor of all the other components.",
1246,,"Personally I like the margherita pizza better, but they are all good.",
1247,,Possibly the Most Romantic Restaurant in the City,
1248,,"This is undoubtedly my favorite modern Japanese brasserie (that don’t serve sushi), and in my opinion, one of the most romantic restaurants in the city!",
1249,,"Not only is it an adventure getting to this somewhat hidden spot, once you enter the unmarked wooden doors, the zen and intimate décor will make you feel like you’re no longer in the city.",
1250,,"If you’re planning to come here, make sure that your date is someone whom you really like since you’ll be ushered to private booths where there will be no people or food watching (choose the ones on the ground level that have glass ceilings so you may see the stars in the sky!).",
1251,,It’s just you and your date and an occasional cute ‘excuse me’ before the waiter opens the little curtain to your booth!,
1252,,"My party had the BBE $29 fixe prix menu, which was such a wonderful deal since it also came with a flight of sake!",
1253,,I never used to be a fan of sakes but am lately experimenting with it a lot more and am acquiring a better taste of it.,
1254,,We started off with a delightful sashimi amuse bouche.,
1255,,Our first course was Tuna Sashimi with Green Yuzu Sauce.,
1256,,"I picked the Grilled Black Cod as my entree, which I absolutely devoured while someone commented that the Grilled Salmon dish was better.",
1257,,The entrees were served with miso soup and rice.,
1258,,The sake’s complimented the courses very well and is successfully easing me into the sake world.,
1259,,"For desserts, we tried the frozen black sesame mousse (interesting but not extraordinary) and matcha (powdered green tea) and blueberry cheesecake, which was phenomenal.",
1260,,"Maybe it was the great company (I had friends visiting from Philly – yes, it was not a date this time) or the super reasonable price point, but I just can’t say enough good things about this brasserie.",
1261,,"I don’t usually visit the same establishment more than once, what more twice, but I’ll come to Zenkichi anytime for a quiet, unhurried and memorable dinner.",
1262,,Terrible would be a compliment!,
1263,,"The service leaves much to be desired, from feeling like you are rushed the place your order, to being ignored the rest of the night.",
1264,,"We were 10 people celebrtating a birthday, we sat in the tent.",
1265,,We paid a fixed pricce but got nothing!!,
1266,,We never ate because by close to 2 in the monring we were not served and were too upset ad tired to start eating.,
1267,,"They are extremely rude, not even apologizing for the horrible service we got and handing us a bill well over $500 for some drinks adn their pita bread!",
1268,,Stay away,

1270,,Celebrated my fathers birthday here.,
1271,,The food tasted very good.,
1272,,The family seafood entree was very good.,

1275,,"Price is high but the food is good, so I would come back again.",
1276,,Good Food,
1277,,I went here with my boyfriend for our anniversary.,
1278,,"The food was great and tasty, but the sitting space was too small, I don't like being cramp in a corner.",
1279,,Over all it was a very nice romantic place .,
1280,,I would recommend to ask for a bigger sitting area when you make a reservation (if possible),
1281,,Loved it,
1282,,A coworker and I tried Pacifico after work a few Fridays and loved it.,
1283,,The atmosphere was great.,
1284,,"The food we ordered was excellent, although I wouldn't say the margaritas were anything to write home about.",
1285,,"Our waitress wasn't mean, but not especially warm or attentive either.",
1286,,"I must say I am surprised by the bad reviews of the restaurant earlier in the year, though.",
1287,,Maybe it has improved since then?,
1288,,"Regardless, we'll be back and can't wait to visit in the summer to take advantage of the patio.",
1289,,Dumbfoundingly Poor,
1290,,"This was, from start to finish, a mind-bogglingly uncomfortable experience.",
1291,,Lexicographers take note: a new and fascinating definition of rudeness is alive and flourishing right here in Brooklyn.,
1292,,The servers at Flatbush Farm appear to have perfected that ghastly technique of making you feel guilty and ashamed for deigning to attract their attention.,
1293,,Polite acknowledgement is out;,
1294,,supercilious scorn is in.,
1295,,"And how many times can you pick up the same perfectly aligned set of napkins, inspect them vapidly and plonk them down in exactly the same place instead of venturing a glance at people who are there to help you make the rent?",
1296,,"A different server enhanced the fun, dumping our entrees in front of us halfway through our appetizer (which was delicious).",
1297,,"Overall the food quality was pretty good, though I hear the salmon is much better when it hasn't sat cooling in front of the guest.",
1298,,"The place has a nice fit-out, some attractive furnishings and, from what I could tell, a reasonable wine list (I was given the food menu when I asked for the carte des vins)",
1299,,"At $120 for two people, however, this in no way represents value, unless you're looking to pay by the hour for passive-aggressive torture.",
1300,,"On that scale, it's a world-beater.",
1301,,cirspy crust margherita pizza,
1302,,we have been there 3 times since last week we alked it by chance first day the manager offerd us the margherita pizza adn we said yes.,
1303,,it was really good pizza.,
1304,,the crust was imazingly cooked well and pizza was fully loaded:):):),
1305,,you know what i mean all the positives things happening there made mw write this review.,
1306,,Great Hot Dogs!,
1307,,I've made the trip out here a few times with a friend who lives nearby (I live on UWS).,
1308,,"Though it's been crowded most times I've gone here, Bark always delivers on their food.",
1309,,"The hot dogs are top notch, and they're Slamwich is amazing!",
1310,,"Going to Bark is always worth the train ride, and will make your tongue and belly very happy!",
1311,,Only complaint is the pricing--I believe it would be more reasonable to pay a dollar less on each item listed on the menu.,
1312,,"But nonetheless--great spot, great food.",
1313,,Best meal in a long time!,
1314,,Mussles and calamari were superb Saturday evening.,
1315,,I had the Lamb special which was perfect.,
1316,,"My father had the flank steak which was very good, and my mother had the swordfish.",
1317,,The Four Seasons restaurant is a great experience.,
1318,,The food is great and the environment is even better.,
1319,,Everyone must come here at least once.,
1320,,Highly recommend it!,
1321,,Taking Hot Dogs to the next level,
1322,,"At first glance this place seems a bit pricey for a hot dog joint, but at Bark you don't just get your average hot dog.",
1323,,Here the hot dog is elevated to the level of a real entree with numerous variations available.,
1324,,Poor service and management,
1325,,Don’t go to this place!,
1326,,Had an awful experience at Casa la Femme on a Saturday dinner.,
1327,,Appetizers took nearly an hour.,
1328,,When the main course finally arrived (another 45mins) half of our order was missing.,
1329,,Never got an explanation as to what was going on.,
1330,,The manager was rude and handled the situation extremely poorly.,
1331,,"When we threatened to leave, we were offered a meager discount even though half the order was missing.",
1332,,"On the way out, we heard of other guests complaining about similar issues.",
1333,,Can’t believe how an expensive NYC restaurant can be so disrespectful to its clients.,
1334,,So rude!!!,
1335,,I went with JWILS.,
1336,,Her review is above.,
1337,,I was one of the people that went for this horrible experience.,
1338,,My friend is 100% right in the experience we had.,
1339,,The hostess was rude and I got a distinct feeling that they did not want to serve us.,
1340,,The only thing that my friend left out is that when we sat down at the bar the bartender disappeared.,
1341,,I asked for a menu and the same waitress looked at my like I was insane.,
1342,,"I was shocked that my friends wanted to stay after the waitress said, ""can I help you"" and ""how many are in your party.""",
1343,,What?,
1344,,The three of us standing in front of her should have been an indication of how many of us there were.,
1345,,We didn't look like the other patrons in there so unfortunately I think that may have been part of the problem.,
1346,,Shame on this place for the horrible rude staff and non-existent customer service.,
1347,,bad staff,
1348,,I generally like this place.,
1349,,The food is good.,
1350,,The design of the space is good.,
1351,,But the service is HORRID!,
1352,,"I was there for brunch recently, and we were tag teamed by a waitress and a waiter.",
1353,,The waiter delivered our food while holding what appeared to be a plastic bag of garbage in one hand.,
1354,,"I can't believe that it was, but please put the bag down before delivering food!",
1355,,"The waitress came to check in on us every few minutes, and began to clear the plates while half of us were still eating (a big pet peeve of mine that happens almost everywhere, so I try to ignore it).",
1356,,"I couldn't ignore the fact that she reach over the plate of one of my friends, who was in mid bite, to clear the table.",
1357,,"She then put the check down without asking if we were done, and came to check on the bill every two minutes, even though we were one of three occupied tables.",
1358,,"I wish I could like this place more, and I wish someone would retrain the staff.",
1359,,LLOOVVE THIS PLACE.,
1360,,Food is excellent.,
1361,,Fish is so very fresh.,
1362,,Waitstaff are very friendly.,
1363,,Love YUKA.,
1364,,"Obviously the Chinese translation of this place does not mean Big Wong, it actually means Great Prosperity.",
1365,,The food here does a great service to the name (Cantonese that is...).,
1366,,I fell in love with the egg noodles in the beef broth with shrimp dumplings and slices of BBQ roast pork.,
1367,,This dish is my favorite and I always get it when I go there and never get tired of it.,
1368,,"Try the congee and the donut like deep fried dough they call Ow Ley Soh, a delicious and sweet tasting bread.",
1369,,Simply some good tasting Chinese food at incredible prices...,
1370,,Service is not what you are coming here for...,
1371,,Just make sure my ice water is kept full and my tea kettle filled with piping hot tea and that's all the service I need...,
1372,,Big Wong is a great place to eat and fill your stomach.,
1373,,"i've been to sapphire twice and both times the food was fine, if not good.",
1374,,"stick with the chicken, beef, and lamb dishes.",
1375,,i don't usually order wine with indian so i can't comment on their wine list or their wines.,
1376,,instead ordered an ice cold beer which to me works with indian.,
1377,,"service is friendly, and never had a problem walking in and getting a table.",
1378,,i would recommend reservations on weekends though.,
1379,,skip dessert.,
1380,,Great Atmosphere,
1381,,Went to this place this place on a real cold night and needed a quick meal.,
1382,,"I highly recommend the fish tacos, everything else was ok.",
1383,,"Cool atmosphere, the fire place in the back really ads to it but needs a bit more heat throughout on a cold night.",
1384,,"As a Japanese native, I've lived in the Tristate area for over 8 years, but I was just so amazed at this place.",
1385,,This place is the most Japanese it can ever get.,
1386,,"The signs, the specials menus, food, and even all the waitstaff are ALL TOTALLY Japanese.",
1387,,This place is worth an one-hour drive.,
1388,,"I am so coming back here again, as much as I can.",
1389,,We had a great time at the Jekyll and hyde Pub last night.,
1390,,We were walking around the village and went into this place just for some drinks.,

1393,,The place's decor and hidden bathrooms made for a good laugh.,
1394,,I highly recommend visiting this restaurant and having dinner and drinks!,
1395,,Big Wong gets big Ups for a fine establishment.,

1397,,The atmosphere is noisy and the waiters are literally walking around doing things as fast as they can.,
1398,,The food is prepared quickly and efficiently.,
1399,,"And it all comes at a very reasonable price (congee, noodles, and rice dishes are no more than $3-6 each).",
1400,,The takeout is great too since they give high quality tupperware as well.,
1401,,This place is always very crowded and popular.,
1402,,"With the exception of our lemon salad that had so much pepper on it that our eyes started watering, the food here was decent, not great.",
1403,,The menu is very limited - i think we counted 4 or 5 entrees.,
1404,,"We ordered the special, grilled branzino, that was so infused with bone, it was difficult to eat.",
1405,,"The decor in this place is very diner-ish and the kind of place you expect in the East Village - not romantic, just simple, small and sparse.",
1406,,Problem is nothing at Prune is particularly memorable.,
1407,,No plans to return anytime soon.,
1408,,I thought this place was totally overrated.,
1409,,Everything we had was good or ok....but definitely nothing great.,
1410,,"The ambience was nice, but service wasn't so great.",
1411,,"When you add it all together, it just doesn't seem worth it to me...especially considering the prices.",
1412,,"The atmosphere is nothing special, but it feels like a Sushi establishment in Tokyo.",
1413,,The owner and staff are all Japanese as well and that adds to the entire ambiance.,
1414,,"Despite a slightly limited menu, everything prepared is done to perfection, ultra fresh and a work of food art.",

1430,,"The food and service were fine, however the maitre-D was incredibly unwelcoming and arrogant.",
1431,,"While finishing our meals which included a high-end bottle of wine, our son's fiance joined us for a glass of wine and dessert.",
1432,,"This guy refused to seat her and she left, followed shortly by the four of us, but not before I told him that in my 40 years of world travel, including Paris, that I had never seen such a display of bad behavior by a frontman in a restaurant.",
1433,,"His response was smug, arrogant, and condescending, totally consistent with his deportment on display all evening.",
1434,,"A word to the wise: you can't dine here and disturb the maitre-D's sense of "" table turnover"", as whacked as it is, or else.",
1435,,"If you go here, do it on his off-night.",

1437,,We live nearby BFC.,
1438,,"It's a little out of our price range for dining there except on special occasions, but we've eaten there 6 times in the last 2 years.",
1439,,"Each time we've been, the front of house staff (not the waiters - they're fantastic - but the people who greet and seat you) has been so hideous to us that were it not for the exceptional fish dishes I would never return.",
1440,,"As BFC doesn't take reservations you almost always have to wait by the bar - and be abused by the front of house staff until you are seated, which can be over an hour later!",
1441,,The frizzy retro girl (with winged/ Dame Edna glasses) will yell at you if you try to order a drink.,
1442,,"I was almost amused by the fact that she was turning away customers at 9pm on a Friday night because she ""had a BBQ to go to"" that night - WTF??",
1443,,I'd be horrified if my staff were turning away customers so early and so rudely!,
1444,,"There's another girl who I can't describe, she is about 5'6"" with brown hair, who eavesdrops on your conversation and chimes in - except she only hears the last part of what you said, so her uninvited opinions are often out of context and nothing to do with what you're *really* talking about.",
1445,,"I'm a friendly person, so I wouldn't mind had she not been so nasty and gotten so personal.",
1446,,"Again, I'd be super upset if that were my employee.",
1447,,"Considering you will spend at least $60 a head, I expect better service.",
1448,,"So, if you're walking by and thinking about dining, you might want to see who's going to be seating you first...",
1449,,"Average to good Thai food, but terrible delivery.",
1450,,I've waited over one hour for food.,
1451,,They were very abrupt with me when I called and actually claimed the food was late because they were out of rice.,
1452,,A Thai restaurant out of rice during dinner?,
1453,,"The food arrived 20 minutes after I called, cold and soggy.",
1454,,I got an excellent piece of cheesecake and we had several other nice pastries.,
1455,,"I would recommend Roxy's for that, but not for their food.",
1456,,My son and his girlfriend both wanted cheeseburgers and they were huge!,
1457,,"But, they were too big for the bun.",
1458,,"Consequently, their burgers fell apart in their hands and made such a mess that they did'nt feel like finishing them.",
1459,,Also they were $15 each!,
1460,,I had a huge pastrami sandwich on a roll.,
1461,,It was $14 not really bad for a pound of Pastrami-but it didn't have much taste-I've had better for less elsewhere!,
1462,,We had the lobster sandwich and it was FANTASTIC.,
1463,,"My husband said he could've eaten several more, the portion was fine for me he even exclaimed that the french fries were the best he has had.",
1464,,We had the scallops as an appetizer and they were delicious and the sauce was wonderful.,
1465,,I recommend getting a reservation even though we saw people seated without one.,
1466,,We waited at the bar and had martinis that were just right.,
1467,,We will be back.,
1468,,I've been here twice now.,
1469,,"The first time the sushi was outstanding, the second time it was a little bland.",
1470,,I'm sure I'll return for a final judgement tho.,
1471,,"The blond wood decor is very soothing, the premium sake is excellent and the service is great.",
1472,,"Good spreads, great beverage selections and bagels really tasty.",
1473,,THE BIG COMPLAINT: NO TOASTING AVAILABLE.,
1474,,I complete the total bagel experience by having it lightly toasted.,
1475,,Murray won't do it.,
1476,,Won't or Can't is not in the service directory.,
1477,,But who says Murray's is anything about service.,
1478,,"So close, but not good enough.",
1479,,"This is some really good, inexpensive sushi.",
1480,,"It costs $2 extra to turn a regular roll into an inside-out roll, but the roll more than triples in size, and that's not just from the rice.",
1481,,The spicy Tuna roll is huge and probably the best that I've had at this price range.,
1482,,The Yellowtail was particularly good as well.,
1483,,"I have reservations about the all you can eat deal, however -- the choices are fairly limited and you can probably order more food than you can eat for less than $18 by just going off the menu.",
1484,,"In any event, this is a place I'll be sure to stop by again when I'm in this part of town.",
1485,,The food is amazing... especially if you get the Chef's tasting menu and your favourite bottle (or two!) of wine from an extensive selection of wines.,
1486,,"The place is small and intimate and you may feel a little crowded, but the service is excellent and it's great for friends out, a romantic date, or a special occassion.",
1487,,People dress in suits or evening gowns as well as shirts jeans.,
1488,,The food can get pricey but the prixe fixe tasting menu is the greatest food for a good price and they cater the food to any food allergies or food you don't like.,
1489,,"Recommendations, of course, are required!",
1490,,Please be aware that it's CASH or AMEX only!,
1491,,"I had my eyes on this place, promising myself I will one day 'give it a try.'",
1492,,And I hate to say this but I doubt I'll ever go back.,
1493,,"The food is very average...the Thai fusion stuff is a bit too sweet, every thing they serve is too sweet here.",
1494,,The only thing I moderately enjoyed was their Grilled Chicken special with Edamame Puree.,
1495,,I had never had Edamame pureed before but I thought it was innovative and tasty (could've used a bit more salt).,
1496,,"Anyways, if you're in the neighborhood to eat good food, I wouldn't waste my time trying to find something, rather go across the street to Tamari.",
1497,,"The decor is night tho...but they REALLY need to clean that vent in the ceiling...its quite un-appetizing, and kills your effort to make this place look sleek and modern.",
1498,,"I've had the lunch buffet at Chennai a couple of times, when I have been in the neighborhood.",
1499,,"It is terrific, as is the value.",
1500,,"$6 and there is much tasty food, all of it fresh and continually refilled.",
1501,,"I am not a vegetarian but, almost all the dishes were great.",
1502,,"Frankly, when you compare what you can have here for lunch, versus McDs or so many other sandwich shops in the city, there is no comparison.",
1503,,Go hungry and enjoy.,
1504,,"I have never eaten in the restaurant, however, upon reading the reviews I got take out last week.",
1505,,IT WAS HORRIBLE.,
1506,,The pizza was delivered cold and the cheese wasn't even fully melted!,
1507,,It looked like shredded cheese partly done - still in strips.,
1508,,I have eaten at many pizza places around NYC and this is hands down the worst.,
1509,,This is the best sushi in new york city - hands down.,
1510,,The place is small and cramped but the food is fantastic.,
1511,,Get the tuna of gari.,
1512,,The one on the east side is much better than the one on the west side.,
1513,,"Great service, great food.",
1514,,Prices are in line.,
1515,,"Compared to other shabu restaurants around town, this places wins hands-down.",
1516,,But too far east!,
1517,,There are many Thai places in the city but so far Toons is #1.,
1518,,Their pad penang is delicious and everything else is fantastic.,
1519,,The price is reasonable although the service is poor.,
1520,,This place is so much fun.,
1521,,Our family never expected such incredible entertainment in a restaurant.,
1522,,This place must have cost the owners afortune to build.,
1523,,I think the stuff was better than Disney.,
1524,,Our food was great too!,
1525,,And really large portions.,
1526,,The staff was the friendliest that have seen in New York.,
1527,,We will go back every time we are in the City.,
1528,,If you want something really different than try Jekyll and Hyde.,
1529,,It is a lot of fun with live entertainment and all kinds of Disney type special effects.,
1530,,The food was pretty tradional but it was hot and good with large portions.,
1531,,I highly recommend it.,
1532,,I am going to the mid town location next.,
1533,,"We have tried every Thai restaurant between Atlantic Avenue and 4th Streets, and Joya is the best.",
1534,,"The freshest, best variety, and the fastest delivery.",
1535,,Also very inexpensive.,
1536,,A great choice at any cost and a great deal.,
1537,,This tiny Williamsburg spot is always pleasantly surprising.,
1538,,The pizza is delicious and the proprietor is one of the nicest in NYC.,
1539,,Even the pasta is delicious here (a rarity in New York pizza restaurants).,
1540,,I've been many time and have never been disappointed.,
1541,,"Compared to Ess-a, Tal offers a less doughy bagel!",
1542,,They even scoop it out nice (for those on a diet) not too much not to little.,
1543,,The cream cheeses are out of this world and I love that coffee!!,
1544,,A little crowded but they move that line really fast!,
1545,,A little pricey but it really hits the spot on a Sunday morning!,
1546,,I thought going to Jimmys would give me a real Domincan exprience.,
1547,,Jimmy is Dominican!,
1548,,"Well, this place is so Ghetto its not even funny.",
1549,,If you like your music blasted and the system isnt that great and if you want to pay at least 100 dollar bottle minimun then you'll love it here.,
1550,,Would NEVER go back there.,
1551,,Too bad Latin Quarters closed.,
1552,,"That place was awesome,,,  sally !",
1553,,"For authentic Thai food, look no further than Toons.",
1554,,"Ive been to many Thai restaurants in Manhattan before, and Toons is by far the best Thai food Ive had (except for my mom's of course).",
1555,,"Try the Pad Thai, or sample anything on the appetizer menu...they're all delicious.",
1556,,"Do not get the Go Go Hamburgers, no matter what the reviews say.",
1557,,They were such a rip-off ($8.95 for four small meat patties in steamed buns) and not worth trying.,
1558,,"The rest of the dim sum, though pricey by Chinatown standards, is worth it.",
1559,,Steamed fresh so brought hot hot hot to your table.,
1560,,"The wait here is long for dim sum, but if you don't like sharing tables or if the typical raucous dim sum atmosphere is not your gig, this is a sleek (for Chinatown) alternative.",
1561,,"A few tips: skip the turnip cake, roast pork buns and egg custards.",
1562,,These are overpriced and you can get better just around the corner:,
1563,,(1) turnip cakes at the little kiosk on east side of Mott St. just south of bayard,
1564,,(2) egg custards and pork buns at either bakery on west side of Mott street just south of Canal.,
1565,,Lucky Strike is a great casual place to just grab a bite to eat.,
1566,,"Yeah the crowd can take it a bit seriously, but it shouldn't.",
1567,,"Great food, great decor, great service.",
1568,,I recommend it!,
1569,,Just ignore the trendy wannabes.,
1570,,"Out of the hundreds of Italian restaurants in Queens, this is among the best.",
1571,,The shrimp scampi was excellent and the antipasti were plentiful.,
1572,,It is expensive but well worth the money.,
1573,,"If you venture off the island of Manhattan and can't seem to find a great Italian restaurant, drive to Corona.",
1574,,"As a fan of Thai, I have tried quite a few different restaurants in NYC and this one was definitely the worst.",
1575,,"The food was not fresh, the sauces were bland and very oily.",
1576,,It just wasn't Thai.,
1577,,Consistently good Japanese Tapas.,
1578,,"Same owner as the guy who owns Typhoon, which is just down the street on St. Marks and 1st Ave.",
1579,,Always good drinks and service is pretty good;,
1580,,Atmosphere is nice and relaxed too...,
1581,,A great place to meet up for some food and drinks...,
1582,,Yakitori (bbq meats) is tasty too.,
1583,,"It's also attached to Angel's Share, which is a cool, more romantic bar...",
1584,,Overpriced and not tasty,
1585,,The food here was mediocre at best.,
1586,,It was totally overpriced- fish and chips was about $15....,
1587,,There are so many other great places to go to eat and drink..... this place is not worth it...,
1588,,overpriced japanese food with mediocre service,
1589,,Went here on sat 1/26 and was disappointed.,
1590,,Chicken teriyaki had tomato or pimentos on top??,
1591,,food was luke warm.,
1592,,The waitress was not attentive at all.,
1593,,I was looking for banana tempura for dessert and they dont have.,
1594,,Too many other good places to have to settle.,
1595,,Favorite Sushi in NYC,
1596,,"I have eaten at some of the 'best' sushi joints in NYC (Nobu, Bond Street, JewelBako, etc) and Yamato is my favorite.",
1597,,"An unpretentious spot in Park Slope, the sushi is consistently good, the service is pleasant, effective and unassuming.",
1598,,"In the summer months, the back garden area is really nice.",
1599,,The rolls are creative and I have yet to find another sushi place that serves up more inventive yet delicious japanese food.,
1600,,"The Dancing, White River and Millenium rolls are musts.",
1601,,Gross food – Wow-,
1602,,I can't remember the last time I had such gross food in New York.,
1603,,My quesadilla tasted like it had been made by a three-year old with no sense of proportion or flavor.,
1604,,And $11 for a plate of bland guacamole?,
1605,,Come on.,
1606,,"Don't get me started on the margaritas, either.",
1607,,Mine tasted like the bartender had forgotten to add the tequila.,
1608,,"Really, I find it rather scandalous that such a crappy restaurant attracts such crowds--this, in the city of a million restaurants, at least 9/10 of which are way better than this one.",
1609,,Save your money and your time and go somewhere else.,
1610,,"Oh, and I never write reviews--I just was so moved by how bad this place was, I felt it was my duty to spread the word.",
1611,,You want to have a real hot dog in Brooklyn?,
1612,,Skip Nathan's...you can get that at the mall...go to Bark.,
1613,,"Delicious, creative and fun.",
1614,,would NOT go back.,
1615,,"Service ok but unfriendly,filthy bathroom.",
1616,,The high prices you're going to pay is for the view not for the food.,
1617,,"The bar drinks were Eh, ok to say the least.",
1618,,The stuff tilapia was horrid...tasted like cardboard.,
1619,,"We thought the dessert would be better, Wrong!",
1620,,$170 down the toilet...,
1621,,"oh speaking of bathroom , the mens bathroom was disgusting.",
1622,,"The floor was wet, the trash can filled with hand towels n all over the floor, no soap, and no hand towels left.",
1623,,Go to son cubano in edgewater nj instead.,
1624,,Impressed...,
1625,,Subtle food and service,
1626,,Noodle pudding is exactly the type of service and food I enjoy.,
1627,,"Servers are all different, Greg is my favorite.",
1628,,"Sometimes tables don't understand his sense of humor but it's refreshing to have a server who has personality, professionalism, and respects the privacy of your dinner.",
1629,,This is the first place I've been that a runner remembers my order... hope he likes his job because I have half a mind to steal him for my restaurant.,
1630,,Prices are fair across the board for both food and bev.,
1631,,"I go out to eat and like my courses, servers are patient and never rush courses or force another drink.",
1632,,Restaurants in manhattan should try to model food and service after this place.,
1633,,"There is ""Expensive-but-worth-it"" and there is ""Expensive-and-WTF""?",
1634,,This is a twenty-something guy that doesn't mind laying down $300 for a fine and delicious meal for 2 on special occassions.,
1635,,But $500 for a dinner for two that didn't include Wine?,
1636,,Are you freaking kidding me?,
1637,,"Look, the appetizers were really good.",
1638,,The entree was also very good.,
1639,,"Can't argue about that, but they are clearly over priced.",
1640,,What you are paying for is the environment and the name.,
1641,,"Yes, the place is classy and beautiful, but they most certainly target the uber whealthy Not the common joe that wants to go all out every once in a while.",
1642,,$500 included:,
1643,,Drinks: 2 glasses of Dom Perignon at $35 each.,
1644,,Starters: Kobe Beef Sashimi.,
1645,,Which of course is not real Kobe but Wagyu beef.,
1646,,Surprised that a place of this caliber would advertise it as Kobe.,
1647,,A beef Consomme.,
1648,,Entrees: Vanison steak and Bison Steak.,
1649,,Vanison was good but not amazing.,
1650,,Bison was quite excellent however.,
1651,,Dessert: pure disaster.,
1652,,Just not good at all.,
1653,,Some Pineapple covered in a glaze of some kind and some pear tart thing Not impressive at all.,
1654,,"I read reviews that called the restaurant too expensive and I thought to myself, but may be it is worth it.",
1655,,I was wrong.,
1656,,"The Four Seasons has history and it is a sort of landmark of New York City restaurants, but trust me, they will charge you through the nose just so that you can say ""I've been to the four seasons restaurant"".",
1657,,"I wanted to go there to see if it was worth it and sadly, curiousity got the best of me and I paid dearly for it.",
1658,,"All in all, the food was great (except for the dessserts).",
1659,,The environment is very upscale and you will see a lot of rich guys with trophy wives or just highly paid escorts.,
1660,,"If you are going for the food, it will not be worth it.",
1661,,"Yes, it is good, but I've had better for cheaper.",
1662,,"You would think they would make up for it with service, sadly, no.",
1663,,"Service was just ok, it is not what you'd expect for $500.",
1664,,Great Shabu Shabu,
1665,,"I go here at least once every other week, particularly when it's cold!",
1666,,I love it.,
1667,,To be honest we only ever eat the Shabu Shabu.,
1668,,I tried a couple other dishes but wasn't too impressed.,
1669,,"But for the Shabu Shabu, you won't find much better in NY.",
1670,,In fact there is only one I've tried that even compares (shabu Tatsu) and even then I prefer Dokebi.,
1671,,"The meat is fresh, the sauces are great, you get kimchi and a salad free with your meal and service is good too.",
1672,,This place doesn't make any sense,
1673,,Just want to warn you all - don't waste your time and money.,
1674,,"This place has totally weird decor, stairs going up with mirrored walls - I am surprised how no one yet broke their head or fall off the stairs - mirrored walls make you dizzy and delusional...",
1675,,This place is not inviting and the food is totally weird.,
1676,,The concept of japanese tapas is newly created and clearly doesn't work.,
1677,,"The food they serve is not comforting, not appetizing and uncooked.",
1678,,Go to japanese sushi place or Spanish tapas place - this creation in Williamsburg is a misstake.,
1679,,How is this palce still open?,
1680,,I honestly don't even know where to begin.,
1681,,"My boyfriend and I are avid restaurant goers, and we are always on the lookout for new places and our friend had recommended Flatbush Farms.",
1682,,"We arrived and were seated immediately, which made us both happy.",
1683,,"We ordered our appetizers, I ordered the chicken and my boyfriend the salmon.",
1684,,Everything was going good until we got our meals.,
1685,,I took one look at the chicken and I was appalled.,
1686,,"It was served with skin, over a bed of extremely undercooked spinach and mashed potatoes.",
1687,,"My boyfriend asked me if I wanted to switch and eat his salmon instead, while he de-skinned the chicken so that I could enjoy the white meat.",
1688,,"I took one bite from the $24 salmon, and I have never, in the 17 years I have been going to restaurants tasted salmon as fishy, as dry, and as bland as the one in Flatbush Farms.",
1689,,"At this point, the waitress comes over and asks us if everything was okay, I was literally so shocked that I was speechless and didn't say anything, and guess what, the waitress WALKED away.",
1690,,"So, I switch with my boyfriend again to see if maybe I could stomach the meat and spinach again, but the spinach was so undercooked that I just could not bite through it.",
1691,,I couldn't even enjoy the mashed potatoes because it was hidden completely under the chicken and spinach.,
1692,,I've had better chicken at BBQs!!!!,
1693,,So I decide to report back to the waitress because it was completely inedible.,
1694,,"Guess what, I waited for TWENTY minutes before she came over and when she finally did, she says, ""oh well, I wish you would have said something earlier"" No apology, nothing.",
1695,,"After that she simply took our plates, walked away, came back another TWENTY minutes later with the bill and the chicken on it!!!!!!!!!!!!",
1696,,"No desert menu, no apology, nothing!!!!!!",
1697,,"I was literally going to explode, but instead, my boyfriend took the bill and went to find the manager.",
1698,,"This is where it really really gets bad: the manager said, there is absolutely nothing we can do, it's a matter of taste that she didn't like it, and I cannot comp it.",
1699,,"Again, no apology, no is there anything else I can get you, no can I get you a drink to make up for it, nothing!!!!",
1700,,We refused to pay for it because at this point it had nothing to do with the food anymore.,
1701,,The level of rudeness was preposterous.,
1702,,"The manager came to the table and said we can do what we want, so we paid for what we did enjoy, the drinks and appetizers, and walked out.",
1703,,I HAVE NEVER EVER HAD SUCH AN UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE.,
1704,,THIS STAFF SHOULD BE FIRED.,
1705,,What a hassle!,
1706,,"The food is very good, but not outstanding.",
1707,,"There is no way it justifies the accolades it receives, the attitude of the staff or the wait for a table.",
1708,,"On our last visit, they skipped over our name on the list, leaving us waiting an extra hour for a table.",
1709,,"Mistakes happen, but they are usually accompanied by an apology, perhaps even a glass of wine...but not the grunt that we received from the Al Di La staff.",
1710,,"Without the wait or attitude, I would probably go back, but there are just too many other restaurants in Brooklyn that are as good or better and don't make me jump through hoops.",
1711,,Expensive,
1712,,I went there after hearing how great it was.,
1713,,Wow.,
1714,,"The bread was stale, the salad was overpriced and empty.",
1715,,"The pasta was well cooked, didn't have enough sauce though or flavor.",
1716,,I though it was expensive and I prefer Bella Via just blocks away by far.,
1717,,Baluchi's has solid food and a nice decor at reasonable prices.,
1718,,The only problem is that the manager is a complete incompetent.,
1719,,He offers subpar service and has no personality.,
1720,,"In fact, it appears he is going to go postal at any moment.",
1721,,Skip this location and go to the one in Soho.,
1722,,There is no excuse for such lousy service!,
1723,,Single Worst Restaurant in Manhattan,
1724,,"I'll being with a couple of positives: cool decor, good pita and hummus, and grilled octopus that was actually pretty tasty.",
1725,,Moving on.,
1726,,If I could give 0 stars I would do so for this place.,
1727,,Casa La Femme is to middle eastern dining what Chuckie Cheeze is to italian.,
1728,,The reason there are 4 different results on citysearch for the same place is because they keep trying to start a new thread so they can stock it with positive reviews.,
1729,,Well...they can run but they can't hide.,
1730,,I live in the West Village and I've been to a lot of restaurants.,
1731,,"Sometimes you pay a lot and don't get much in return - it's manhattan, things are expensive.",
1732,,"However, most of them are at least prompt and pleasant.",
1733,,This place...god where do i begin.,
1734,,It is quite a spectacular scene i'll give them that.,
1735,,The decor however seems to be the distraction so you won't notice that you just payed 300 bucks for some cold eggplant that took 2 FRICKIN HOURS TO COME!!!!,
1736,,"How this place survives the competitive west village market in this economy, or any other for that matter, is beyond me.",
1737,,I live a block away and go to Patsy's frequently.,
1738,,"The pizza is delicious - they use fresh mozzarella instead of the cheap, frozen, shredded cheese common to most pizzaria's.",
1739,,"Two complaints- their appetizer selection stinks, it would be nice to get some mozzarella sticks on the menu.",
1740,,"Also, because it is so thin, it gets cold very quickly and its not that filling.",
1741,,So eat fast and order a lot.,
1742,,Wait staff is blantently unappreciative of your business but its the best pie on the UWS!,
1743,,I was there on sat. for my birthday and we had an excellent time.,
1744,,I had the best ravioli ever.,
1745,,The wine the service was very good too.,
1746,,Moderate prices.,
1747,,A little noise but I think that was because of our party!,
1748,,Mermaid Inn is an overall good restaurant with really good seafood.,
1749,,The menu is limited but almost all of the dishes are excellent.,
1750,,The lobster sandwich is good and the spaghetti with Scallops and Shrimp is great.,
1751,,The service is good and ambience is good for a date or group outing.,
1752,,The only fallback on this restaurant is the prices.,
1753,,"Even though its good seafood, the prices are too high.",
1754,,The lobster sandwich is $24 and although it was good it was not nearly enough to warrant that price.,
1755,,this place... we stumbled upon it on labor day weekend.,
1756,,"whoever the jazz duo was, they were on POINT.",
1757,,"good music, great food, speedy service affordable prices.",
1758,,even the wine by the glass was good.,
1759,,"its a little out of the way if you don't live in the neighborhood, but definitely worth the trip from wherever you are.",
1760,,I was very disappointed with this restaurant.,
1761,,Ive asked a cart attendant for a lotus leaf wrapped rice and she replied back rice and just walked away.,
1762,,I had to ask her three times before she finally came back with the dish Ive requested.,
1763,,"Food was okay, nothing great.",
1764,,Chow fun was dry; pork shu mai was more than usually greasy and had to share a table with loud and rude family.,
1765,,I/we will never go back to this place again.,
1766,,I'm not sure where the other reviewers ate but it seems as if we visited two different restaurants because my friends and I all enjoy Mizu very much... and we're repeat customers.,
1767,,Even after they overcharged me the last time I was there.,
1768,,Make sure you have the Spicy Scallop roll.. .,
1769,,it's delicious!,
1770,,"I tend to judge a sushi restaurant by its sea urchin, which was heavenly at sushi rose.",
1771,,"It melted in my little mouth and the perfect consistency-not too fishy, creamy, and slightly buttery.",
1772,,The sushi seemed pretty fresh and was adequately proportioned.,
1773,,The rice to fish ration was also good--they didn't try to overpack the rice.,
1774,,We took advanatage of the half price sushi deal on saturday so it was well worth it.,
1775,,"I am not the most experienced person when it comes to Thai food, but my friend who took me there is.",
1776,,He has visited Thailand and is quite expert on the cuisine.,
1777,,It was wonderful.,
1778,,"the salads are delicious, both refreshing and very spicy.",
1779,,We had Pam's special fried fish and it was amazing.,
1780,,too large for just two people but nothing was left.,
1781,,Unbelievable.,
1782,,I go and eat out at many different restaurants and this is one place you have go and try.,
1783,,This is my first time writing a review for a restaurant because the food and service was excellent.,
1784,,The filet mignon dish was superb!,
1785,,I would defiantly come back here again as one of my top choices.,
1786,,It's a small cute restaurant.,
1787,,I visit New Green Bo when I have money or when I am broke.,
1788,,"I recommend the jelly fish, drunken chicken and the soupy dumplings, certainly the stir fry blue crab.",
1789,,The food is so cheap and the waiters are nice.,
1790,,"Of course, it is crowded but who cares.",
1791,,Authentic Shanghai style and I cannot recommend a better Shanghai place in New York.,
1792,,More Williamsburg Garbage,
1793,,My wife and I visited Dokebi tonight.,
1794,,We ordered dosut bibimbap and nakgi-bokum.,
1795,,The dishes came out around 5 minutes apart.,
1796,,"The bibimbap was average, but the stone bowl wasn't even close to sizzling.",
1797,,Too bad I had paid an extra $2 for the stone bowl.,
1798,,The nakgi-bokum was horrible.,
1799,,Easily the worst stir-fried squid I've ever tasted.,
1800,,The sauce tasted more like Chinese fast food than decent Korean.,
1801,,"The side dishes were passable, and I did get a refill upon request.",
1802,,The real problem I had with this place was the complete lack of service.,
1803,,I mentioned the squid dish wasn't very good when the waitress visited.,
1804,,She just nodded and walked off.,
1805,,"There were no communications issues either, as she spoke perfect English.",
1806,,"As to my comment about the food, no apology or acknowledgment was made.",
1807,,My wife had barely touched that mess of a dish.,
1808,,We were charged full price.,
1809,,"If you ware looking for Korean fusion, I suggest you try some of the places in the East Village.",
1810,,"Authentic Korean food lovers should visit 32nd Street, of course.",
1811,,I was speechless by the horrible food.,
1812,,"I attended a holiday dinner at the restaurant, and the food was majorly disappointing.",
1813,,"Rather than eating the meat entree being offered, I requested a vegetarian dish.",
1814,,"Rather than preparing vegetarian dish, the chef presented me with a plate of steamed vegetables (minus sauce, seasoning, or any form or aesthetic presentation).",
1815,,"I was so stunned, and I left the dinner hungry and majorly disappointing.",
1816,,This place survives on reputation alone.,
1817,,I will NEVER return.,
1818,,Great Indian food and the service is incredible.,
1819,,The owner truly caters to all your needs.,
1820,,"When family came in he gave them apps to test their palets, and then ordered for them.",
1821,,Everyone was more then happy with his choices.,
1822,,Great food and the prices are very reasonable.,
1823,,I have been to Rao's probably 15 times the past 3 years and it keeps getting better.,
1824,,"For those that go once and don't enjoy it, all I can say is that they just don't get it.",
1825,,Rao's has the best service and atmosphere in NYC.,
1826,,Good luck getting a table.,
1827,,Planet Thai is great!,
1828,,"We love the food, drinks, and atmosphere!",
1829,,"The svc can be a bit rude at times, esp if you have big group, but overall the restaurant is a must!",
1830,,"Try the Pad Thai, it's fabulous and their prices are so cheap!",
1831,,"Just because it's cheap does NOT mean the portions are small or the food is nasty, IT IS GREAT!",
1832,,"Just remember, the later you go, the longer you may have to wait.",
1833,,It's popular w/the late crowd.,
1834,,Patroon features a nice cigar bar and has great staff.,
1835,,The food is tasty and portion sizes are appropriate.,
1836,,This is a nice restaurant if you are looking for a good place to host an intimate dinner meeting with business associates.,
1837,,Not a great place for family or general dining.,
1838,,Great Indian food,
1839,,"I lived on 50th st, and wanted Indian one day so decided to check this place out.",
1840,,"Food was amazing - I love Indian food and eat it quite regularly, but I can say this is one of the best I've had.",
1841,,"Very ""normal Indian food"", but done really well.",
1842,,"I have it a 4 instead of 5 because of the price (just chicken tikka masala - no bread of rice - is $25), which I would expect at a upscale Indian restaurant but this place doesn't have an upscale feel.",
1843,,"Also, waiters try to push more food on you, like suggest things as if they are complimentary when they actually cost $.",
1844,,I don't appreciate places or people that try to drive up the bill without the patron's knowledge so that was a huge turnoff (more than the price).,
1845,,"But if you're prepared to spend some $ and remember to ask if something they offer is complimentary, then this is the place to go for Indian food",
1846,,Went to Ottimo and was expecting outstanding pizza (as I love La Pizza Fresca).,
1847,,Was surprisingly disappointed.,
1848,,Pizza was a little soggy.,
1849,,Ravioli was good...but I have to say that I found everything a bit overpriced.,
1850,,Not enough wines by the glass either.,
1851,,"Service, however, was excellent...and I liked the setting/atmosphere a lot.",
1852,,"Food was just average...if they lowered the prices just a bit, it would be a bigger draw.",
1853,,"Don't dine at Tamarind for the vegetarian dishes, they are simply not up to par with the non-veg selections.",
1854,,Decor is nice though service can be spotty.,
1855,,This place is always packed.,
1856,,I know because I live nearby.,
1857,,"Most importantly, food is excellent.",
1858,,Try the sea bass.,
1859,,Highly recommended.,
1860,,"They forgot a sandwich, didn't include plastic forks, and didn't include pita with the hummus platter.",
1861,,"Also, the sandwiches (nearing $7) didn't come with anything like chips or a side.",
1862,,"Overall, not worth the money.",
1863,,"Eating in, the atmosphere saves it, but at your desk, it's a very disappointing experience.",
1864,,i went to utsav about a yr ago with my family.,
1865,,The food was good.,
1866,,The place was nice and calm.,
1867,,but the service was a bit slow.,
1868,,Don't go with a larger group than 4!,
1869,,I went here for a family birthday dinner.,
1870,,Five of us walked in at approximately 6:20 on a Thursday evening.,
1871,,"The hostess said ""Wow that's a large group, unless you aren't together"", to which I replied ""no we are, and there will be one more, so a table for six please.""",
1872,,"At first we were a little taken aback, as this seemed to present a problem, although the restaurant looked fairly empty, but they hastily put the table together for us.",
1873,,The menu is fairly simple without much descriptions.,
1874,,"There was no tap beer that evening, which was a disappointment.",
1875,,"Not much of a selection of bottled beer either, we went with Brahma.",
1876,,The appetizers we ordered were served quickly - an order of fried oysters and clams were delicious but a tiny portion (maybe 3 of each).,
1877,,"The lobster knuckles (special of the day) were ok, but pretty tasteless.",
1878,,"I believe there were 2 shrimp in the ""salt encrusted shrimp"" appetizer.",
1879,,After we ate our appetizers (which took all of 8 minutes) we ordered another round of Brahma's - and tried to stall a little as we waited for our sixth dinner member.,
1880,,The waitress appeared and asked us if we wanted to go ahead and order.,
1881,,We replied that we would like to wait 5 more minutes if that was okay.,
1882,,"She replied ""well it would be more convenient for us if you ordered now, since you are a larger party, and it might get crowded.""",
1883,,"We called the other person who was very close by, and she told us to order for her, so we did.",
1884,,The food arrived in about 15 minutes.,
1885,,I had the Thai style Fried Sea Bass...which was very good.,
1886,,"Everyone seemed generally happy with their food, except my brother who had the grilled Mahi Mahi, seemingly drenched in Grapfruit Juice!",
1887,,I heard the lobster roll was excellent.,
1888,,"They seemed to continue to rush us along, taking plates without asking if we were done (my sister still had her fork in hand).",
1889,,"All in all the food was good - a little on the expensive side, but fresh.",
1890,,"Service not the friendliest to our ""large party""!",
1891,,Probably would not go back here.,
1892,,"To celebrate a birthday, three of us went to Mare anticipating great food.",
1893,,Not one of our meals was edible - bland and/or made with weird rosemary or orange flavoring.,
1894,,Fish was overdone.,
1895,,"Cute place, nice wait staff but would never go there again.",
1896,,Someone else recommended the dessert - we also left that.,
1897,,One of us actually liked the expresso - that's it.,
1898,,"Skip this restaurant, it's a big disappointment.",
1899,,Was there Friday night.,
1900,,Best Pastrami I ever had and great portion without being ridiculous.,
1901,,And I've been to many NYC delis.,
1902,,My wife had the fried shrimp which are huge and loved it.,
1903,,Price no more than a Jersey deli but way better.,
1904,,"Everytime I decide to try another place on the UES, I get angry that I didn't just go to Zucchero Pomodori.",
1905,,This is by far my favorite place in the neighborhood.,
1906,,"The service is excellent, the decor is great, and the food is delicious and comes in large portions.",
1907,,"You'll pay at least double at any other Italian restaurant in the city, and most still don't compare.",
1908,,I'm partial to the Gnocchi.,
1909,,"Went here last night - nice decor, good service, but the food was surprisingly excellent.",
1910,,"The portions are HUGE, so it might be good to order three things to split (rather than one appetizer and entree per person) for two people.",
1911,,"Among all of the new 5th avenue restaurants, this offers by far one of the best values for your money.",
1912,,Can't wait to go back.,
1913,,"I love Ess-a-bagel, but I live on the west side, so I often go to Murray's for convenience.",
1914,,"Their bagels are fine, but they are a little overcooked, and not really a 'special' bagel experience.",
1915,,"Better than the bagel shop on the corner, but not worth going out of your way for, in my opinion.",
1916,,Also a little more expensive than your average bagel place.,
1917,,The service was excellent and the food was delicious.,
1918,,"We are very particular about sushi and were both please with every choice which included: ceviche mix (special), crab dumplings, assorted sashimi, sushi and rolls, two types of sake, and the banana tempura.",
1919,,"Overall the restaurant is more expensive than our other sushi favorites, but everything was delicious.",
1920,,Definitely a great spot for a nice occasion or date.,
1921,,This small Astoria souvlaki spot makes what many consider the best gyros in New York.,
1922,,"Small, bright, and clean, BZ Grill stands apart from the usual run of gyro joints, both in Astoria and out.",
1923,,"What really makes it shine is the food, which is aggressively seasoned with Cyrpriot spices, and all made in-house (even the gyro meat and sausages), and made of much higher quality ingredients that might otherwise be expected.",
1924,,"All the various Greek and Cypriot dishes are excellent, but the gyro is the reason to come--if you don't eat one your trip was wasted.",
1925,,I was here a few weeks back and we had the worst customer service experience at a restaurant ever.,
1926,,"A gentleman, maybe the manager, came to our table, and without so much as a smile or greeting asked for our order.",
1927,,"When asked about how a certain dish was prepared in comparison to a similar at other thai restaurants, he replied this is not Mcdonald's, every place makes things differently",
1928,,"While it is understandable that every place is indeed different, there was not a need to be uncourteous to customers and downright rude.",
1929,,"The service was poor, restaurant poorly lit, staff not very attentive and I would have rather eaten at a Mcdonald's than this joint.",
1930,,Never again!,
1931,,After passing by this restaurant for sometime I finally decided to go in and have dinner.,
1932,,I was pleasantly suprised.,
1933,,The food was exceptional.,
1934,,"The menu consisted of standard brassiere food, better then places like Balthazar etc.",
1935,,"I choose to go with one of the special, the braised lamb shank in red wine, which was excellent.",
1936,,The service was friendly and the atmosphere was casual.,
1937,,The restaurant is a bit noisy but that is something that can be overlooked once you sit down and enjoy a great meal,
1938,,"Having hunted around for a quiet, romantic, yet not hideously expensive restaurant I stumbled across reviews for La Lanterna and gave it a shot.",
1939,,Quite simply it's like stepping out of Manhattan and into a haven of tranquility.,
1940,,"The service was attentive, yet unimposing, the food was far better than many notorious restaurants in Midtown and the wine list is extensive and well priced.",
1941,,The Prix Fixe menu is worth every penny and you get more than enough (both in quantity AND quality).,
1942,,I will be going back and heartily recommend it!,
1943,,Suan is a great place that I often take my friends (classmates) too.,
1944,,"Its location is good and the fact that Hutner College is near and their prices are very reasonable, makes students go back to Suan again and again.",
1945,,I LOVE their Thai,
1946,,noodles with shrimp and chicken and coconut juice is the MUST!,
1947,,"I was in love with Pongsri on 48th, but compared to Suan it is slow in service and overpriced.",
1948,,I will go back to Suan soon!,
1949,,In summer-eat outside on a terrace (another great feature of Suan)!!!,
